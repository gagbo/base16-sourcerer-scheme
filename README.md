# Sourcerer Base 16 theme

This theme is tentatively based on the very good
[Sourcerer](https://sourcerer.xeno.nu) theme. I did not test it, I just want to
have this ready if one day I want to go the base16 way with my colors.

If someone knows the lightest, quickest way to test the templates in a base16
yaml file I am all ears.
